# Pragmadev Process API

Requires a working installation of Pragmadev Process with a working license.

## Docker

With a nodelocked license the docker scripts should work out of the box.

Build the image with

```sh
$ bin/build_docker
```

And then run with

```sh
$ bin/run_docker
```

The server can be launched in the background with

```sh
$ bin/run_docker -d
```
